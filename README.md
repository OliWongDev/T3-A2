Physio program prescribing web application developed by Kane Campbell, Steve Todorovic and Oliver Wong

## The Purpose of "App"

### Task Outline

### Target Audience

### User Stories + Agile Goal Setting

### Functionality
- App has a practitioner/instructor. They prescribe a generated program to the students using a database collection of exercises.
- The practitioner has the ability to set the human-readable instructions that may be personalized to the student's needs.
- Users have full CRUD capability of their own profiles, can sign out.
- Admins have full CRUD capability of their programs. Ability to update sequentially as the patient moves through treatment.
### Features
- Sign-Up/Login
- Notes that the admin and patient can write on the program, to engage in light discourse about how the program is going. (Dated)

### Tech Stack
- MERN
- "Wireframes program"
- "Dataflow Diagram program"
- "Application Architecture Diagram program"
- "Trello"
- Key Dependencies/Packages
- Maybe any public APIs used?

## Data Flow Diagrams

The Data Flow Diagram task was split up into two diagrams so that it would be easier to understand and read. This is because there is one user entity and over 30 processes of data moving back and forth. As such, we divided the diagram by collection; one for the user collection and the other for the program collection.

It is important to note that for the program collection DFD, it is implied that the user is logged in/authorized and that that data process has already been completed.

As a team we begun confirming what our idea would look like, what features we could add and what would be a bonus if we had time. After we were happy with this, we set out to divide our tasks and used Trello to motivate the team. We would assist on individual tasks if our team needed help.

- Kane begun with wireframes.
- Steve worked on user stories templates, the description of the application and sitemap imagination.
- Oliver worked on the Trello board, setting up the git repo and assisting Steve with the vision of the project.

After having our organisational process set up and our idea cemented, we continued on our work from yesterday. Kane continued to work on our design element; throwing design ideas for us to agree on and further getting through the task of the wireframes.

Steve was tasked with the software architecture diagram as well as helping Oliver to get across the data flow diagram.

Oliver worked on the data flow diagram with Steve and found the collaboration made it a smoother process of understanding. 

The team also sought help from the support educator on campus (Iryna) to understand what the database/collections/documents would look like so future structural problems of integration could be mitigated.
